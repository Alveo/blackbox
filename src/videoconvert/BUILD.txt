BUILDING C++ code

This directory contains a C++ extension to convert raw video to AVI format 
that makes use of the flycapture2 library.  It uses the Boost python
library to expose the C++ class to Python and is built using the bjam
build tool that comes with Boost.  If the flycapture2 libraries 
are installed, it should be possible to build with just:

$  cd cpp
$  bjam

the configuration is in cpp/Jamfile.  This should result in the
shared library being written to RawToAvi.XXX in this directory
where XXX is .so for Linux and perhaps .pyd for windows (needs
confirmation).

This was developed on Linux but should be cross platform - needs
confirmation.

Build on windows:

d:\boost_1_47_0\bjam.exe address-model=64
