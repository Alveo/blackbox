BigASC Black Box Software

This directory contains the Python software utilities for the BigASC Black Box. There are
two main programs:
 - the recording interface (recorder.py)
 - the file copying utility (copier.py)
 
there are also a number of support files needed by these two programs in subdirectories. 

These should be installed by unzipping or copying to the root folder on the D: drive of the
Black Box.  This should give a folder D:\SSCP-GUI.

The two scripts can be run by double clicking on the relevant .py files. Shortcuts to these
should be made on the desktop of the Black Box.
