# Austalk Blackbox Software

This is an archive of the software used to collect the Austalk
speech corpus.  This ran on Windows 'blackbox' hardware and ran
the protocol for data collection.  It is unlikely to build
any more but is of interest to people working on the Austalk
as it includes the detailed protocol for data collection.
